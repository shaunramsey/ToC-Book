# My Great Book

<h2>Some Notes from Emilee</h2>
<ul>
<li> Use <term>alphabet(<m>\Sigma</m>)<term> based on MathJax functionality - will likely be useful for animation</li>
<li>in <!-- TODO--> comments you must keep todo as the first four letters </li>
<li>for me to run graphics: cp generated-assets/latex-image/* output/html/images/.</li>
<li> When inserting images, I have the width set to 50% (<image xml:id="FAMachineOgExample" width="50%">)</li>
<li> How should I go about naming figures from a consistency standpoint? NOTE: I ended up going with
<ul>
<li> FA/RE/TM + Ex + Number</li>
<li> above is preceeded by an i in the figure tag </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> you must re-click the "LATEX" button on Evan's thing to get it to update</li>
<li>trap reject, null, drop state </li>
<li>how to put boxes around figures? mess with sizes?</li>
<li>figure out terms for glossary and index (state machines for machines and explain)</li>
<li>put idx tag around a term to go in the index! This won't show in the build but will link to it in the index! exciting stuff! BUT must be viewed as part of server, not just refereshed HTML page</li>
<li>With Evan's nodes that may need to be moved bc of size, change circle size and x axis and node x axis.</li>
<li> Can the REX and REX to NFA chapters be combined?</li>
<li>Since proofs automatically need to be expanded, should we look at renaming something else?</li>
</ul>
