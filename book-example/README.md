<h2>Some Notes from Emilee</h2>
<ul>
<li> Use <term>alphabet(<m>\Sigma</m>)<term> based on MathJax functionality - will likely be useful for animation</li>
<li>in <!-- TODO--> comments you must keep todo as the first four letters </li>
<li>for me to run graphics: cp generated-assets/latex-image/* output/html/images/.</li>
<li> When inserting images, I have the width set to 50% (<image xml:id="FAMachineOgExample" width="50%">)</li>
<li> How should I go about naming figures from a consistency standpoint? NOTE: I ended up going with
<ul>
<li> FA/RE/TM + Ex + Number</li>
<li> above is preceeded by an i in the figure tag </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> you must re-click the "LATEX" button on Evan's thing to get it to update</li>
<li>trap reject, null, drop state </li>
<li>how to put boxes around figures? mess with sizes?</li>
<li>figure out terms for glossary and index (state machines for machines and explain)</li>
