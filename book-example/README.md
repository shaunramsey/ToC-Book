<h2>Some Notes from Emilee</h2>
<ul>
<li> Use <term>alphabet(<m>\Sigma</m>)<term> based on MathJax functionality - will likely be useful for animation</li>
<li>in <!-- TODO--> comments you must keep todo as the first four letters </li>
<li>for me to run graphics: cp generated-assets/latex-image/* output/html/images/.</li>
<li> When inserting images, I have the width set to 50% (<image xml:id="FAMachineOgExample" width="50%">)</li>
<li> How should I go about naming figures from a consistency standpoint?</li>
<li> you must re-click the "LATEX" button on Evan's thing to get it to update</li>
<li> For exercises, do we want to keep them as figures? I feel like the labels can get a little messy?</li>
</ul>
