      <title> Determinism </title>
      <subsection>
        <title>Set Review</title>
        <p>The <term>alphabet (<m>\Sigma</m>)</term> is the finite set of all possible characters in a language.
        Characters in the alphabet can be appended together to create strings. These strings can be used in a set of recognizable
        strings, also known as a <term>language(<em><m>L</m></em>)</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example, characters <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are all included in alphabet <m>A</m>. 
        <me>\Sigma_{A} = \{a, b, c\}</me>
        Alphabets can include the empty set <m>\emptyset</m> and all characters in the alphabet can be used to create strings such as <m>S</m> and <m>Q</m>
        <me>S = baba</me>
        <me>Q = aaaaa</me>
        these example strings may be included in language <m>A</m>
        <me>L_{A}\in(S, Q)</me>
        </p>

      <!-- todo: Should determinism come before finite automata and the explinantion of states? I feel like 
      explaining vocabularly, examples of languages in CS terms students would know at this point, and 
      some sort of example of how to think about these concepts could be useful to provide background
      before going into states and automata and determinism. I am also a little confused as to how to explain
      determinism at this point. -->
        <title>Deterministic</title> 
        <term>Determinisim</term> means that all transitions of state are unique and completly defined.

         <title>Finite Automata (FA)</title>
         <p><term>Finite Automata (FA) </term> are machines <m>(M)</m> that describe a language. They have no memory storage,
         but they utilize <term>states</term> to determine if a given string exists in the language of the machine. States are 
         represented using circles and machines are made up of states and arrows connecting them. There is also one arrow without
         a beginning state. This arrow points to the start state which is where the machine diagram begins. There are also states with two circles,
         these are accept states. When a string finishing parsing on an accept state, then it is included in the language of the machine.

         Say there in a string <m>S = 110</m>. After following the arrows to parce through <m>S</m>,
         it would be accepted by <m>M_1</m> as it finished on the accept state. We now know that <m>L(M_1)\in S</m>,

        The language of a FA can be determined by creating test strings from characters in the given alphabet and
         checking them using a given machine. For <m>M_2</m>, test strings could include 000, 01, 11011, and 100001. By 
         tracing through <m>M_2</m>, it can be seen that it would only accept on the second and fourth strings, the only
         ones ending in 01. This is a straight-forward example, and many more test strings could be needed to determine 
         the languages of other machines.
