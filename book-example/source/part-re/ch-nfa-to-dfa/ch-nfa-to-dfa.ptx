      <p>
        As introduced in <xref ref="PowerSet"/>, there is a limit to the amount of states that a NFA can have.
        This means that all NFAs can become DFAs as the transitions on each character can be determined for each state.
        The length of the power set is also the greatest amount of states that a DFA made from a NFA can have.

          For this, consider <m>M_{12}</m>.

          <m>M_{12}</m> is a NFA. An <m>1</m> at <m>A</m> will lead to both <m>B</m> and <m>D</m>. 
          This is an example of parallelism. 
            What is the maximum number of states a DFA created from <m>M_{12}</m> could have?
          </p>
        <answer>
          <p>
            <m>32</m>. A DFA made from <m>M_{12}</m> can have up to <m>32</m> states as <m>M_{12}</m> has <m>5</m> 
            states and <m>2^5 = 32</m>.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <p>
          How is a NFA made into a DFA? The goal is to make a set of all posible destination states for each character 
          from each state. In <m>M_{12}</m>, a <m>1</m> at <m>A</m> could go to <m>B</m> or <m>D</m>. A <m>0</m>
          at <m>A</m> would go to an <m>\emptyset</m> state.

          Try to create the states that <m>{B,D}</m> would lead to. There is a posibility that each state in a set 
          is active. If one state in a set is an accept state, then the state that includes it in its set is also an accept 
          state.

          When there is a set including multiple states, track the destiation states for all characters in the language. Ask yourself questions such as: where would an 
          <m> a </m> a go after <m>C</m>?, where would a 1 go after <m>D</m>?, and where would a 0 go after <m>E</m>. Try to complete the next step of the diagram.

          It is important to note, that if the outcoming state set of a chaacter already exists that state sholuld be linked to instead of another created. 
          Try creating the final FA with this in mind.

          This small NFA appears to be challenging when trying to decipher its language. Use subset construction to converst it into a DFA and then decipher its 
          language.
