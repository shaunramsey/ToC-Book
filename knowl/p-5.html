<div class="para">Sets are a collection of objects where there is no ordering and elements are not repeated or counted. Sets can contain other sets or they can be empty. The <dfn class="terminology">empty set</dfn> is generally referred to as <span class="process-math">\(\emptyset\text{,}\)</span> the null set. It may also be written as <span class="process-math">\(\{\}\)</span> Typically we use curly brackets to denote set notation. . Thus a set described in <dfn class="terminology">enumeration notation</dfn> as <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span> is a set that contains elements <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> , <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> That is the same set as <span class="process-math">\(\{b,a,c\}\text{.}\)</span> Ordering does not matter. If a <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> were added to this set, we would have a new set <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,c,d\}\text{.}\)</span> If an <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> were added to this set, it would not change the set because the set already contains <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> We will use enumeration notation right away to start describing important elements for this book. Enumeration notation is most often used when all items in a set can be described or a pattern can easily be inferred by the notation. Since "easily inferred" is subjective, we find it best to be explicit in our descriptions and notations.</div>
