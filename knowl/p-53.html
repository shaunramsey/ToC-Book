<div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(M_{10}\)</span> contains an example of an NFA caused by an empty string transition. When processing a string like "bba" we might start by tracking with our fingers. They start in <span class="process-math">\(Q_0\)</span> but quickly we see we exist in <span class="process-math">\(Q_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q_6\)</span> as well. When the first "b" is read, we fall off the first two states and move from <span class="process-math">\(Q_6\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(Q_7\text{.}\)</span> To track this with a computer, given the knowledge we have so far, we would have to use some form of guess and check with backtracking (like a depth-first search) or we could create children processes to handle the different traces to run things in parallel. What a conundrum! Let us see if we can do something about that in the future.</div>
