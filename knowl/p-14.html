<div class="para"> Unlike the finite automata presented in this book, a traditional finite automata will not have halt states. Traditionally an FA will operate continuously (imagine a red light or a vending machine that takes coins). Such a finite automata will not have halt states, but instead will have states represented by a circle withing a circle. Such states are accept states. When an automata finishes processing an input string, it will accept if it is in an accept state (state with a double circle), otherwise it will reject the input string. The approach presented in this book is beneficial because it operates more closely to how you would program software to operate. For example, a language that only needs to look at the first symbol of an input string, could immediately halt and accept or halt and reject based on that symbol. If your need does not include processing the whole string, then we do not bother in the model presented in this book.</div>
