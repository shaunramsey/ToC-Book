<div class="para">One way to start to understand the language of a FA is by creating test strings from characters in the given alphabet and checking them using a given machine. For <span class="process-math">\(M_2\text{,}\)</span> test strings could include 000, 01, 11011, and 100001. By tracing through <span class="process-math">\(M_2\)</span> with each of these four string separately, we see that it accepts  the second and fourth strings, the only ones ending in 01. This is a straight-forward example, and many more test strings could be needed to determine the languages of other machines. When wrapping our mind around state machines in this way, it is helpful to think about what each state is representing. Sometimes it is acquired by a sequence like "have seen a 0 followed by a 1." Sometimes it remembers a modulus of sorts like "seen an even number of 0s" or "seen a binary string that represents a number divisible by 3". Practice with these machines and languages will help acquire this skill and insight but later in the book we will see some other methods for translating machines to expressions which might be useful in this endeavor when the machines are complicated, although although those expressions are often more complicated than the machines themselves!</div>
