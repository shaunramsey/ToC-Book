<div class="para">All CFGs can be put into CNF. The steps to do so are outlined below.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Add a new start state that is a clone of the old one. This new start state is typically called <span class="process-math">\(S_0\text{,}\)</span> while the original start state remains <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Remove an <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon\)</span> transition by simulating it. If there are more empty string transitions, repeat this step until no more remain or only the new start state has an empty string rule.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Look for  <dfn class="terminology">unit rules</dfn> and replace them by cloning. A unit rule is when a variable goes to the same variable.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Look for rules with terminals that are not alone. Make new rules for those teminals.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Look for rules with more than two variables. Make new rules to turn them into two seperate rules.</div></li>
</ol>
<div class="para">When you complete this process, every rule will have only two variables on the right hand side or a terminal by itself. The only exception here is the new start state which can have an empty string transition.</div>
