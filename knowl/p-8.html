<div class="para">To start off thinking about theory of computation, we need a few base terms that we will use in the rest of this book. For the most part, in theory of computation we talk about machines. You can think of these automata or machines like functions. They take input in the form of a string (an ordered sequence of symbols) and they either accept or reject that input. As we continue through the course, we will add more power to the capabilities of these machines in the form of memory. At first, the machines can only switch between a finite set of states. However, as we progress to other sections of this book, we will allow these machines to gain access to different types of infinite memories. Letâ€™s look at a few important sets that we will need to discuss our automata.</div>
