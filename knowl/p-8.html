<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">subset</dfn>  is simply a collection of things where those things are items that belong in another set. It is often denoted with the symbol <span class="process-math">\(\subseteq\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(\{a\}\)</span> can be a subset of any other set that contains <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b\}\text{,}\)</span> and even <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span> are all subsets of <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,c\}\text{.}\)</span> In fact, <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span> has quite a few subsets. Can you list all 8? So, a set, <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> is a subset of a set, <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> when all the elements in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> are elements in <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> We will write <span class="process-math">\(A
\subseteq B\)</span> to mean that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a subset of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> In this case, <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> can have all the things of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> some of the things, or even none of the things of B. In the latter case if <span class="process-math">\(A \subseteq B\)</span> and A has no elements of B in it, then A would also be <span class="process-math">\(\emptyset\text{.}\)</span> Convince yourself that this is true.</div>
