<div class="para">The only way to get comfortable with these new terms and operators is by using them. So, feel free to think of this section as a brief reference on notation, definitions and operators. Come back to read about power sets, intersection and union when you need them. Keep this section handy as a reference to remind yourself what these symbols and terms mean, until you do not need them anymore. Anytime you see <span class="process-math">\(\{ \}\)</span> you should be thinking about a collection of things and you can come back here if you need a refresher. We will use them quite readily.</div>
