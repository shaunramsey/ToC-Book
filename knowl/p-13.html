<div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Finite Automata (FA)</dfn> are  <dfn class="terminology">state machines (M)</dfn>. We use these machines to describe (recognize) a language. They have no memory storage outside of their finitly many states. They utilize  <dfn class="terminology">states (Q)</dfn> to determine if a given string is accepted or rejected by the machine. You may also say that the FA determines if a string exists in the language of the machine. States do track a kind of finite memory by their position. States are represented using circles and machines are made up of states and arrows connecting them. Finite automata have an entry point - so there is also one arrow without a beginning state. This arrow points to the start state which is where the machine will begin processing its input. In our machines there may also be a halt and accept state. It will be denoted with <span class="process-math">\(h_a\)</span> encased in two circles. A halt and reject state (<span class="process-math">\(h_r\)</span>) may also be present inside a circle within a circle. This is best described alongside diagrams and images. So, the diagrams below will help.</div>
