<div class="para">Sets are a collection of objects where there is no ordering and elements are not repeated or counted. Sets can contain other sets or they can be empty. Things get really tricky when you think about a set that contains an empty set, but we will not need to deal with that just yet. Typically we use curly brackets to denote set notation (enumeration notation). Thus <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span> is a set that contains elements called <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> That is the same set as <span class="process-math">\(\{b,a,c\}\text{.}\)</span> Ordering does not matter. If a <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> were added to this set, we would have a new set <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,c,d\}\text{.}\)</span> If an <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> were added to this set, it would not change the set because the set already contained an <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> We will use enumeration notation right away to start describing important elements for this book.</div>
