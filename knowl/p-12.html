<div class="para"> <dfn class="terminology">Finite Automata (FA)</dfn> are  <dfn class="terminology">state machines (M)</dfn>. We use these machines to describe (recognize) a language. They have no memory storage outside of their finitly many states. They utilize  <dfn class="terminology">states (Q)</dfn> to determine if a given string is accepted or rejected by the machine. You may also say that the FA determines if a string exists in the language of the machine. States do track a kind of finite memory by their position. States are represented using circles and machines are made up of states and arrows connecting them. Finite automata have an entry point - so there is also one arrow without a beginning state. This arrow points to the start state which is where the machine will begin processing its input. In our machines there may also be a halt and accept state. It will be denoted with <span class="process-math">\(h_a\)</span> encased in two circles. A halt and reject state (<span class="process-math">\(h_r\)</span>) may also be present inside a circle within a circle. This is best described alongside diagrams and images. So, the diagrams below will help.  Unlike the finite automata presented in this book, a traditional finite automata will not have halt states. Traditionally an FA will operate continuously (imagine a red light or a vending machine that takes coins). Such a finite automata will not have halt states, but instead will have states represented by a circle withing a circle. Such states are accept states. When an automata finishes processing an input string, it will accept if it is in an accept state (state with a double circle), otherwise it will reject the input string. The approach presented in this book is beneficial because it operates more closely to how you would program software to operate. For example, a language that only needs to look at the first symbol of an input string, could immediately halt and accept or halt and reject based on that symbol. If your need does not include processing the whole string, then we do not bother in the model presented in this book.</div>
