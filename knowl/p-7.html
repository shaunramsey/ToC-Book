<div class="para">However, we will also often use set-builder notation to describes sets. An example of set-builder notation to describe a set is: <span class="process-math">\(\{w | w\ \text{is a string that contains an}\
a\}\text{.}\)</span> This should be read as the set of all <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span>â€™s where <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is a string that contains an <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> We will see this in again in an example shortly. Importantly here, <span class="process-math">\(| \)</span> is read as where or such that. You can think of it as a declaration or assignment if you like. The left is a set. a collection of things, where all the things follow the rules on the right.</div>
