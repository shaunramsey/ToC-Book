<div class="para">As some sets are infinite, we will often use <dfn class="terminology">set-builder notation</dfn>  to describe sets. An example of set-builder notation to describe a set is:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\{w
| w\
\text{is a list of
letters that contains an}\ a\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This should be read as the set of all <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span>’s where <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is a string (list of letters) that contains an <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> We will see this in again in an example shortly. This symbol <span class="process-math">\(|\)</span> is often called a pipe or line. Some programmers may think of it as the ’or’ symbol. However, in this notation, the pipe, <span class="process-math">\(| \text{,}\)</span> is read as where or such that. You can think of it as a declaration or assignment if you like. This is a collection of things defined on the left, where all the things follow the rules on the right.</div>
