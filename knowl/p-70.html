<div class="para">Some of these are not so hard for DFAs but, as we work with things we find that the shortcuts of NFAs allow us to write the machines for such languages more quickly. When your language includes an "or" in its description, it turns out that’s also perfect for an NFA. Since we can make guesses, we can build a machine for each side of the "or" and push them together with empty string transitions. Looking back at <span class="process-math">\(M_{10}\text{,}\)</span> we might describe this language with an "or". We take either the top path or the bottom path. The language then must be all strings that are "aab" or that begin with "bb" followed by any number of a’s.</div>
