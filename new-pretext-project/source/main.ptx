    <introduction>
  <p>
    Let's get started.
  </p>
</introduction>

<section xml:id="section-short">
  <title>Beginnings</title>

  <p>
    This is a short sentence.
  </p>
</section>

<section xml:id="section-multiple-paragraph">
  <title>Endings</title>

  <p>
    This is a longer sentence that is followed by another sentence.
    Two sentences, and a second paragraph to follow.
  </p>

  <p>
    One more short paragraph. If the two sides of a
          right triangle have lengths <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>
          and the hypotenuse has length <m>c</m>, then the
          equation <me>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</me> will always hold.
