      <idx>Context Free Languages (CFLs)</idx> <term>Context Free Languages (CFLs)</term> are good at unbounded inner to outer matching with some 
      concatenation. CFLs and PDAs have the ability to recognize the same class of languages. <m>\Omega</m> is all languages.

          RLs can be expressed using Regular Expressions and Finite Automatas. They can be proven to be regular using the Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages.

        <p>
          Both RLs and CFLs can be espressed by CFGs and PDAs. They can be proven using the Pumping Lemma for CFLs.

      <li>
        <p>
          CFLs that are not RLs, might not obey the Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages, might be able to use closure properties of RLs to prove it is not 
          regular, and must have some sort of unbounded matching.

        Let's look at an example of trying to classify a language as a RL, CFL, or neither. Consider the language below:
        <me>
          L_1 = \{a^n \# a^n\}
        </me>
        First, write a PDA for the language. Can we do it?
      </p>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Yes we can!

        </p>
      </answer>
      <p>
        Second, write a CFG that recognizes <m>L_1</m>. Can we do it?
      </p>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Yes we can!
          <tabular>
            <row>
              <cell><m>CFG_1</m></cell><cell></cell>
            </row>
            <row>
              <cell></cell><cell><m>S \rightarrow aSa | \#</m></cell>
            </row>
          </tabular>
        </p>
      </answer>
      <p>
        So, is <m>L_1</m> a RL, CFL, or both?
      </p>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Since <m>L_1</m> can be expressed as both a PDA and a CFG, it is both a RL and a CFL. 
        </p>
      </answer>

    <exploration>
      <p>
        What language does this PDA recognize?

      </p>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The language is any string with the same number of 0s and 1s.
