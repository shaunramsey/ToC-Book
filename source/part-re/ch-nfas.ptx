    <p><idx>Non-Deterministic Finitie Automata
        (NFA)</idx> <term> Non-Determinisitic Finite Automatas
        (DFA)</term> are FAs where the outcome of each possible change of state is not completely
      determined (see the root words at work here). Some quick examples include, a state that
      transitions to two other states on an input, thus leaving you in multiple states. A state
      where a transition is not defined, thus ejecting you from the machine. We will even allow free
      jumps to new states. </p>

  <section xml:id="Parallelism">
    <title>Parallelism</title>
    <p> NFAs make it possible to exist in two states at once. You might think of this as <idx>
      Parallelism</idx> <term>parallelism</term>. Parallelism can occur because a state has multiple
      paths for the same character. It can also happen because of an <idx>Empty String Transition</idx>
        <term>empty
      string transition</term>. Empty string transitions are free jumps to another state. Sometimes
      these multiple paths and free jumps are called guesses when discussing FAs. Only one execution
      path must lead to an accept, to accept a string in these conditions. </p>
    <p>
      <m>M_9</m> is an example of parallelism caused by a character having two defined paths from
      the same state. Both states <m>B</m> and <m>D</m> would be active if the first character of
      the given string was 1. </p>

    <p> There are two strategies for tracking which states you are in. The first is quite simple,
      track them with your fingers. The second, is to create a transition table similar to that in
      the previous chapter <xref ref="DFADeterminismTable"></xref> but including nondeterminism. </p>

      <m>M_{10}</m> contains an example of an NFA caused by an empty string transition. When
      processing a string like "bba" we might start by tracking with our fingers. They start in <m>
      Q_0</m> but quickly we see we exist in <m>Q_1</m> and <m>Q_6</m> as well. When the first "b"
      is read, we fall off the first two states and move from <m>Q_6</m> to <m>Q_7</m>. To track
      this with a computer, given the knowledge we have so far, we would have to use some form of
      guess and check with backtracking (like a depth-first search) or we could create children
      processes to handle the different traces to run things in parallel. What a conundrum! Let us
      see if we can do something about that in the future. </p>

    <p>Since we might think about NFAs as the ability to exist in multiple states, the
      power set is a useful tool. If we trace our way through an NFA, we'll end up in some set of
      states. That will correspond to one of the entries in the power set. That's a useful idea that
      we'll use in just a moment.

    <title>Strengths of NFAs</title>
    <p> NFAs are often pretty easy to generate for languages that include a certain set of
      characters. Such as: <ul>
        <li><em>Begins with </em> 01</li>
        <li><em>Contains </em> 01 </li>
        <li><em>Ends with </em> 01 </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p> Some of these are not so hard for DFAs but, as we work with things we find that the
      shortcuts of NFAs allow us to write the machines for such languages more quickly. When your
      language includes an "or" in its description, it turns out that's also perfect for an NFA.
      Since we can make guesses, we can build a machine for each side of the "or" and push them
      together with empty string transitions. Looking back at <m>
        M_{10}</m>, we might describe this language with an "or". We take either the top path or the
      bottom path. The language then must be all strings that are "aab" or that begin with "bb"
      followed by any number of a's. </p>

          There is always a choice to be in a state or not.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <answer>
        <p> There are two choices with each state, whether to be in it or to not be in it. This
          means that there are two options for each state, making the maximum size of the power set <m>
          2^n</m>. </p>
